# E2E Pipeline Validation Summary

## Core PoT Framework Integration

### 1. Dynamic Challenge Generation ✅
- **Implementation**: The pipeline now dynamically determines the number of challenges based on the testing mode
- **Source**: Follows `pot_runner.py` pattern - pre-generates challenges up to n_max, then iterates with early stopping
- **Key Changes**:
  - Removed hardcoded `n_challenges` requirement
  - Uses `DiffDecisionConfig` to get n_max from testing mode (QUICK_GATE: 120, AUDIT_GRADE: 400)
  - Generates challenges on-demand during verification

### 2. Statistical Sequential Testing ✅
- **Implementation**: Uses `DifferenceVerifier` with `EnhancedSequentialTester`
- **Features**:
  - Early stopping when statistical decision reached (SAME/DIFFERENT)
  - Anytime-valid confidence intervals using Empirical-Bernstein bounds
  - Separate decision criteria for SAME (equivalence) and DIFFERENT (superiority)

### 3. Cryptographic Pre-commitment ✅
- **Implementation**: `pre_commit_challenges()` method
- **Features**:
  - HMAC-based seed generation for reproducibility
  - SHA256 commitment hash of seeds
  - Deterministic challenge generation from seeds

### 4. Model Verification ✅
- **Implementation**: `run_verification()` method
- **Features**:
  - Loads models dynamically (HuggingFace local or API)
  - Computes similarity scores using edit distance
  - Supports both GPT and DistilGPT models

### 5. Evidence Bundle Generation ✅
- **Implementation**: `generate_evidence_bundle()` method
- **Features**:
  - Comprehensive audit trail with all stages
  - Cryptographic hash of bundle contents
  - Includes challenges used, decisions, and metrics

### 6. Reporting and Analytics ✅
- **Implementation**: Integrated `ReportGenerator` class
- **Features**:
  - HTML report generation with visualizations
  - JSON summary files
  - Stage-by-stage metrics tracking

### 7. Testing Modes ✅
- **QUICK_GATE**: Fast validation (n_min=12, n_max=120, confidence=97.5%)
- **AUDIT_GRADE**: High precision (n_min=30, n_max=400, confidence=99%)

## Validation Results

The E2E pipeline correctly:
1. Determines challenge count dynamically based on mode
2. Generates challenges using cryptographic seeds
3. Performs sequential testing with early stopping
4. Tracks only the challenges actually used
5. Generates comprehensive evidence bundles
6. Creates detailed reports

## Test Output Verification

```
Testing Mode: quick
Max Challenges: Auto (from quick mode)
INFO: Using n_max=120 from quick_gate mode
INFO: Starting difference testing with config: n_max=120
```

The pipeline is now fully integrated with the core PoT framework functionality.
