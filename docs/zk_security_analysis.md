# Zero-Knowledge Proof System Security Analysis

## Executive Summary

The PoT zero-knowledge proof system provides cryptographically secure verification of neural network training steps. This document presents a formal security analysis, including properties, assumptions, limitations, and comparisons with alternative approaches.

## 1. Formal Security Properties

### 1.1 Completeness

**Definition**: If a prover follows the protocol honestly with valid training steps, the verifier accepts with overwhelming probability.

**Property**: For all valid training steps (W_before, W_after, gradients, lr) where:
- W_after = W_before - lr × gradients

The proof generation succeeds with probability 1 - negl(λ) where λ is the security parameter.

**Implementation**:
```python
# Valid witness always produces valid proof
Pr[Verify(Prove(valid_witness)) = 1] ≥ 1 - 2^(-λ)
```

### 1.2 Soundness

**Definition**: A malicious prover cannot convince the verifier of an invalid statement except with negligible probability.

**Property**: For invalid training steps where:
- W_after ≠ W_before - lr × gradients

The probability of generating an accepting proof is negligible:
```
Pr[Verify(π) = 1 | invalid_witness] ≤ 2^(-λ)
```

**Security Level**: 128-bit security (λ = 128)

### 1.3 Zero-Knowledge

**Definition**: The proof reveals no information about the witness beyond the validity of the statement.

**Property**: There exists a simulator S that can produce indistinguishable proofs without knowing the witness:
```
{Prove(witness)} ≈_c {S(statement)}
```

**Information Leakage**: 0 bits about:
- Model weights (W_before, W_after)
- Gradients
- Training data
- Internal computations

## 2. Cryptographic Assumptions

### 2.1 Discrete Logarithm Problem

The security relies on the hardness of the discrete logarithm problem in the Pallas/Vesta curve groups:

**Assumption**: Given g, g^x ∈ G, it is computationally infeasible to find x.

**Security**: ~128 bits for Pallas curve (255-bit prime field)

### 2.2 Poseidon Hash Function

**Assumption**: Poseidon acts as a collision-resistant hash function and random oracle.

**Properties**:
- Collision resistance: Finding x ≠ y where H(x) = H(y) is infeasible
- Preimage resistance: Given H(x), finding x is infeasible
- Second preimage resistance: Given x, finding y ≠ x where H(x) = H(y) is infeasible

### 2.3 Fiat-Shamir Transformation

**Assumption**: The Fiat-Shamir heuristic produces non-interactive proofs with security in the random oracle model.

## 3. Threat Model

### 3.1 Protected Against

✅ **Weight Tampering**
- Any modification to weights invalidates the proof
- Detection probability: 1 - 2^(-128)

✅ **Gradient Manipulation**
- Incorrect gradient computation is detected
- Enforced by circuit constraints

✅ **Training History Forgery**
- Cannot create valid proofs for fabricated training
- Each step cryptographically linked

✅ **Model Extraction**
- Proofs reveal no information about weights
- Black-box security maintained

✅ **Replay Attacks**
- Each proof includes unique step number and epoch
- Timestamps prevent replay

### 3.2 Not Protected Against

❌ **Side-Channel Attacks**
- Timing attacks during proof generation
- Power analysis on proving hardware
- *Mitigation*: Use constant-time operations

❌ **Compromised Proving Key**
- If proving key is leaked, fake proofs possible
- *Mitigation*: Secure key management, HSM storage

❌ **Malicious Circuit Implementation**
- Backdoored circuit could generate invalid proofs
- *Mitigation*: Open-source, audited implementation

## 4. Security Analysis

### 4.1 Attack Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Forging Training Proofs
**Attack**: Adversary tries to create proof without actual training
**Defense**: Soundness property ensures negligible success probability
**Success Rate**: < 2^(-128)

#### Scenario 2: Weight Extraction from Proofs
**Attack**: Adversary analyzes proofs to recover model weights
**Defense**: Zero-knowledge property ensures no information leakage
**Information Gained**: 0 bits

#### Scenario 3: Gradient Inversion
**Attack**: Recover training data from gradients
**Defense**: Gradients never exposed, only commitments
**Success Rate**: Requires breaking Poseidon hash

### 4.2 Formal Security Proof Sketch

**Theorem**: The ZK proof system is secure under the discrete log assumption.

**Proof Sketch**:
1. Assume adversary A can break soundness with non-negligible probability
2. Construct algorithm B that uses A to solve discrete log
3. B simulates proving environment for A
4. When A produces invalid proof, B extracts discrete log solution
5. Contradiction: discrete log is hard by assumption
∴ System is sound

from cryptography.hazmat.primitives import serialization

# Secure key generation
proving_key = generate_proving_key(circuit)
store_in_hsm(proving_key)

# Key rotation
rotate_keys_periodically(days=90)
```

### 7.2 Audit Logging

# Log all proof operations
auditor.log_proof_generation(
    timestamp=time.time(),
    statement_hash=hash(statement),
    proof_hash=hash(proof),
    metadata={"model_id": model_id}
)
```

### 7.3 Monitoring
```python
# Monitor for anomalies
monitor.check_proof_generation_time(threshold_ms=10000)
