## Overview

The PoT framework implements a sophisticated statistical verification system based on **anytime-valid sequential hypothesis testing**. This approach provides several key advantages over traditional fixed-sample testing:

- **Early stopping**: Decisions can be made as soon as sufficient evidence accumulates
- **Anytime validity**: Error rate guarantees hold regardless of when testing stops
- **Efficiency**: Reduces sample complexity by 70-90% in typical scenarios
- **Robustness**: Maintains Type I/II error control under optional stopping

The core methodology combines Empirical Bernstein (EB) bounds with sequential probability ratio tests (SPRT) to create a unified framework for model verification.

## Empirical-Bernstein Bound Theory

### Mathematical Foundation

The Empirical-Bernstein bound provides concentration inequalities for sample means when the variance is unknown. For a sequence of bounded random variables X₁, X₂, ..., Xₜ ∈ [0, 1], the EB bound gives:

**Theorem (Empirical-Bernstein Bound)**: With probability at least 1 - α, for all t ≥ 1:

```
|X̄ₜ - E[X]| ≤ r_t(α)
```

where the radius r_t(α) is defined as:

```
r_t(α) = √(2 σ̂²_t log(log(t)/α) / t) + c · log(log(t)/α) / t
```

**Key Components**:
- `X̄ₜ = (1/t) Σᵢ₌₁ᵗ Xᵢ`: Sample mean at time t
- `σ̂²_t`: Empirical variance (Welford's algorithm)
- `log(log(t)/α)`: Log-log correction for anytime validity
- `c ≥ 1`: Bias correction constant (default c = 1.0)

### Advantages of EB Bounds

1. **Tighter than Hoeffding**: Adapts to actual variance rather than worst-case
2. **Anytime-valid**: Bounds hold simultaneously for all stopping times
3. **Self-normalizing**: No need to specify variance in advance
4. **Optimal rates**: Near-optimal concentration for sub-Gaussian variables

### Implementation in PoT

The EB bounds are implemented in `pot/core/boundaries.py` with several key functions:

```python
def eb_radius(state: CSState, alpha: float, c: float = 1.0) -> float:
    """
    Compute Empirical-Bernstein radius for anytime-valid bounds.
    
    Formula: r_t(α) = sqrt(2 * σ²_t * log(log(t) / α) / t) + c * log(log(t) / α) / t
    
    Args:
        state: Online confidence sequence state
        alpha: Significance level (e.g., 0.05 for 95% confidence)
        c: Bias correction constant (≥ 1.0)
        
    Returns:
        Radius for confidence interval [mean - r, mean + r]
    """
```

## Sequential Hypothesis Testing Background

### Problem Formulation

In model verification, we test the hypothesis:

- **H₀**: μ ≤ τ (model is acceptable, distance below threshold)
- **H₁**: μ > τ (model is different, distance above threshold)

where μ is the expected distance between model outputs and τ is the acceptance threshold.

### Sequential Probability Ratio Test (SPRT)

The classical SPRT by Wald (1947) provides optimal sample efficiency for testing simple hypotheses. However, it requires:
1. Known or specified variance
2. Simple (point) hypotheses
3. Independence assumptions

### Modern Sequential Testing

The PoT framework implements a modern approach that addresses these limitations:

1. **Composite Hypotheses**: Tests μ ≤ τ vs μ > τ (not point hypotheses)
2. **Unknown Variance**: Uses empirical variance estimation
3. **Anytime Validity**: Provides uniform error control over all stopping times

### Test Statistic Evolution

For a stream of distance measurements d₁, d₂, ..., the test evolves as:

```
At time t:
1. Update running statistics: X̄ₜ, σ̂²_t
2. Compute confidence radius: r_t(α)
3. Check stopping condition:
   - If X̄ₜ + r_t(α) < τ: Stop, accept H₀ (model verified)
   - If X̄ₜ - r_t(α) > τ: Stop, reject H₀ (model different)
   - Otherwise: Continue sampling
```

## Anytime Validity Guarantees

### Definition

A sequential test is **anytime-valid** if the Type I error probability is controlled uniformly over all possible stopping times:

```
P(Reject H₀ | H₀ true) ≤ α  for any stopping time τ
```

This is much stronger than controlling error only at a fixed sample size.

### Theoretical Guarantees

The EB-based sequential test provides:

1. **Type I Error Control**: P(False Positive) ≤ α
2. **Type II Error Control**: P(False Negative) ≤ β (for effect sizes > δ)
3. **Uniform Validity**: Guarantees hold for any data-dependent stopping rule

### Martingale Foundation

The anytime validity stems from the martingale property of the test statistic. The key insight is that confidence sequences form a martingale, ensuring:

```
E[sup_t |X̄ₜ - μ| > r_t(α)] ≤ α
```

This uniform bound enables optional stopping without α-inflation.

### Practical Implications

1. **No Multiple Testing Correction**: Unlike fixed-sample tests, no Bonferroni correction needed
2. **Interim Analysis**: Can check results at any time without penalty
3. **Adaptive Stopping**: Can use external criteria (time, cost) for stopping
4. **Robust to Misspecification**: Maintains validity under model violations

## Comparison with Fixed-Sample Tests

### Efficiency Analysis

| Metric | Fixed-Sample | Sequential (EB) | Improvement |
|--------|--------------|-----------------|-------------|
| Average Sample Size | n = 256-512 | n̄ = 20-80 | 70-90% reduction |
| Worst-case Samples | n = 512 | n_max = 500 | Bounded overhead |
| Type I Error | α = 0.05 | α ≤ 0.05 | Guaranteed control |
| Type II Error | β = 0.05 | β ≤ 0.05 | Guaranteed control |
| Decision Time | Fixed | Adaptive | Early decisions |

### When to Use Sequential Testing

**Use Sequential When**:
- Sample acquisition is expensive (API calls, human evaluation)
- Early decisions are valuable (real-time systems)
- Effect sizes vary significantly
- Continuous monitoring is needed

**Use Fixed-Sample When**:
- Batch processing is preferred
- Sample size planning is critical
- Regulatory requirements specify fixed n
- Simplicity is paramount

### Power Comparison

Sequential tests often achieve higher power due to:
1. **Adaptive sample allocation**: More samples for difficult cases
2. **Early stopping**: Preserves power by avoiding dilution
3. **Variance adaptation**: Better performance with heterogeneous data

## Parameter Selection Guidelines

### Significance Levels (α, β)

**Conservative (High-stakes verification)**:
- α = 0.01, β = 0.01
- Use case: Production model verification
- Sample size: Higher, but with early stopping benefits

**Standard (Development verification)**:
- α = 0.05, β = 0.05  
- Use case: Model development and testing
- Sample size: Moderate with good efficiency

**Liberal (Exploratory analysis)**:
- α = 0.10, β = 0.10
- Use case: Initial screening and exploration
- Sample size: Minimal for quick insights

### Threshold Selection (τ)

The acceptance threshold τ should be calibrated based on:

1. **Domain Knowledge**: Typical model differences
2. **Empirical Calibration**: Hold-out validation data
3. **Risk Tolerance**: False positive/negative costs

**Calibration Procedure**:
```python
# 1. Collect reference model outputs on validation set
ref_outputs = reference_model(validation_challenges)

# 2. Compute self-distance distribution
self_distances = [distance(ref_outputs[i], ref_outputs[j]) 
                 for i, j in validation_pairs]

# 3. Set threshold at desired quantile (e.g., 95th percentile)
tau = np.percentile(self_distances, 95)
```

### Bias Correction Constant (c)

The parameter c controls the bias-variance tradeoff in EB bounds:

- **c = 1.0** (default): Balanced, theoretically justified
- **c = 1.5**: More conservative, tighter early stopping
- **c = 0.5**: More aggressive, faster decisions (use with caution)

### Maximum Sample Size

Set `max_samples` to bound computational cost:
- **Development**: 100-500 samples
- **Production**: 1000-5000 samples
- **Research**: 10000+ samples

## Implementation Details

### Core Algorithm

The sequential verification algorithm in `pot/core/sequential.py`:

```python
def sequential_verify(stream, tau, alpha, beta, max_samples, compute_p_value=False):
    """
    Anytime-valid sequential hypothesis test using Empirical-Bernstein bounds.
    
    Tests H₀: μ ≤ τ vs H₁: μ > τ where μ = E[distance]
    
    Mathematical Foundation:
        Confidence interval: [X̄ₜ ± r_t(α)] where
        r_t(α) = √(2σ̂²_t log(log(t)/α)/t) + c·log(log(t)/α)/t
        
    Stopping Rules:
        - Accept H₀ if X̄ₜ + r_t(α) < τ
        - Reject H₀ if X̄ₜ - r_t(α) > τ
        - Continue otherwise
        
    Args:
        stream: Iterator of distance measurements
        tau: Acceptance threshold
        alpha: Type I error rate (false positive)
        beta: Type II error rate (false negative) 
        max_samples: Maximum samples before forced stop
        compute_p_value: Whether to compute anytime-valid p-value
        
    Returns:
        SPRTResult with decision, stopping time, trajectory, and statistics
    """
```

### Numerical Stability

The implementation uses Welford's algorithm for numerically stable variance computation:

```python
def welford_update(state: SequentialState, new_value: float):
    """
    Numerically stable online mean and variance update.
    
    Welford's Algorithm:
        δ = x - mean
        mean_new = mean + δ/n
        M2_new = M2 + δ*(x - mean_new)
        variance = M2/(n-1)
    """
```

### P-value Computation

Anytime-valid p-values use the running maximum statistic:

```python
def compute_anytime_p_value(state: SequentialState, tau: float) -> float:
    """
    Compute anytime-valid p-value using martingale methods.
    
    Based on the law of iterated logarithm correction:
        p_value = 2 * exp(-2 * t * (X̄ₜ - τ)² / σ̂²_t) * log_log_correction(t)
    """
```

## Practical Usage

### Basic Sequential Verification

```python
from pot.core.sequential import sequential_verify

def distance_generator():
    """Generate distance measurements from model comparison."""
    for challenge in challenges:
        dist = compute_distance(candidate_model(challenge), 
                               reference_model(challenge))
        yield dist

# Run sequential test
result = sequential_verify(
    stream=distance_generator(),
    tau=0.05,           # 5% distance threshold
    alpha=0.05,         # 5% false positive rate
    beta=0.05,          # 5% false negative rate
    max_samples=1000,   # Upper bound on samples
    compute_p_value=True
)

print(f"Decision: {result.decision}")
print(f"Stopped after {result.stopped_at} samples")
print(f"Final mean: {result.final_mean:.4f}")
print(f"P-value: {result.p_value:.6f}")
```

### Advanced Sequential Features

from pot.core.sequential import (
    mixture_sequential_test,
    adaptive_tau_selection,
    multi_armed_sequential_verify,
    power_analysis
)

# 1. Mixture testing - combine multiple test statistics

    streams=streams,
    weights=[0.5, 0.3, 0.2],

)

# 3. Multiple hypothesis testing
multi_result = multi_armed_sequential_verify(
    streams={'model_A': stream_A, 'model_B': stream_B},
    hypotheses={'model_A': 0.03, 'model_B': 0.07},
    alpha=0.05,
    correction_method='bonferroni'
)
```

### Integration with Model Verification

# Enable sequential testing in vision verifier
verifier = VisionVerifier(
    reference_model=reference_model,
    use_sequential=True,
    sequential_mode='enhanced'  # Use EB-based method
)

result = verifier.verify(
    candidate_model,
    challenges,
    tolerance=0.05,
    alpha=0.01,
    beta=0.01
)

if result.sequential_result:
    print(f"Early stopping saved {1000 - result.sequential_result.stopped_at} samples")
```

    plot_verification_trajectory,
    plot_operating_characteristics,
    plot_anytime_validity
)

# Visualize single verification trajectory
fig = plot_verification_trajectory(
    result=result,
    save_path='verification_trajectory.png',
    show_details=True
)

# Compare operating characteristics
fig = plot_operating_characteristics(
    tau=0.05,
    alpha=0.05,
    beta=0.05,
    effect_sizes=np.linspace(0.0, 0.1, 20)
)

# Demonstrate anytime validity across multiple runs
trajectories = [run_sequential_test(seed=i) for i in range(100)]
fig = plot_anytime_validity(trajectories, alpha=0.05)
```
