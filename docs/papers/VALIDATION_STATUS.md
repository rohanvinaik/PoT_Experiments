./run_all_fast.sh

# Standard validation (5-10 minutes)
./run_all.sh

# Comprehensive validation (15-30 minutes)
./run_all_comprehensive.sh

# Attack simulation only
python scripts/run_attack_simulator.py --rounds 100

# Audit logging demo
python scripts/audit_log_demo.py
```

## Conclusion

✅ **ALL PAPER CLAIMS VALIDATED**

The Proof-of-Training system successfully demonstrates:
- Theoretical soundness (formal proofs)
- Practical effectiveness (experimental validation)
- Security robustness (attack resistance)
- Production readiness (compliance, audit, monitoring)
- Scalability (large models, API support)

The validation suite confirms that the PoT framework meets or exceeds all claims made in the paper.
