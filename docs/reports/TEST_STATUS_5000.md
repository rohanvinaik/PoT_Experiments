# 5000-PROMPT VERIFICATION TEST STATUS

## Test Configuration
- **Model**: Qwen2.5-72B-Q4 (45.86 GB)
- **Prompts**: 5,000 (standard behavioral verification coverage)
- **Tokens per prompt**: 50
- **Total tokens to generate**: ~500,000
- **Hardware**: Apple M1 Max with Metal acceleration

## Current Status (as of 00:41 AM)
- **Process PID**: 97172
- **Status**: RUNNING - Model loading phase
- **Started**: ~00:32 AM
- **Model load time**: >4 minutes (still loading)

## Expected Timeline
Based on our earlier tests where 300 prompts took >20 minutes:
- **Per-prompt time**: 4-10 seconds
- **Total expected time**: 9-10 hours
- **Expected completion**: ~10:30 AM

## Monitoring Commands
```bash
# Check if still running
ps aux | grep 97172

# Monitor progress
python scripts/monitor_5000_test.py

# Watch log (filtered)
tail -f experimental_results/qwen_5000_output.log | grep -v ggml_metal

# Check checkpoint (once available)
cat experimental_results/qwen_5000_checkpoint.json | python -m json.tool | grep -E "prompts_completed|mean_diff|total_time"
```

## Key Observations So Far
1. **Model loading is SLOW**: >4 minutes just to load 45.86GB model into memory
2. **This alone invalidates the 167-second claim** - we can't even load the model that fast
3. **Memory usage**: ~2.2GB and climbing (process monitor shows 2283920 KB)

## What This Test Will Prove
1. **Actual time** for 5,000 prompt verification
2. **Real speedup** vs 3-hour behavioral baseline
3. **Practical limitations** of 72B model verification
4. **True performance** on consumer hardware

## Checkpoint System
The test saves progress every 100 prompts to:
- `experimental_results/qwen_5000_checkpoint.json`

If interrupted, it can resume from the last checkpoint.

## Final Results Location
Once complete, full results will be saved to:
- `experimental_results/qwen_5000_complete_[timestamp].json`

## Updates
I'll check back periodically to monitor progress. The test runs in background using `nohup` so it will continue even if the session ends.

---

**Bottom Line**: This test will take ~10 hours to complete, which already shows that the "167 seconds for complete verification" claim was misleading. The model alone takes >4 minutes just to load!
