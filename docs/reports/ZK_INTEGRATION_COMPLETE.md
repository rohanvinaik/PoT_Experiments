## 🚀 Usage Quick Start

### Basic SGD Proving
```python
from pot.zk import prove_sgd_step, verify_sgd_step, SGDStepStatement

# Generate proof
proof = prove_sgd_step(statement, witness_data)

# Verify proof
is_valid = verify_sgd_step(statement, proof)
```

### LoRA Fine-tuning
```python
from pot.zk import prove_lora_step, verify_lora_step, LoRAStepStatement

# Generate efficient LoRA proof
proof = prove_lora_step(statement, lora_adapters)

# Verify
is_valid = verify_lora_step(statement, proof)
```

### With Monitoring
```python
from pot.zk import get_zk_metrics_collector

metrics = get_zk_metrics_collector()
report = metrics.generate_report()
print(f"Success rate: {report['success_rate']}%")
```

## 🔧 Building ZK Binaries

```bash
# Navigate to Rust project
cd pot/zk/prover_halo2

# Build optimized binaries
cargo build --release

# Verify binaries
bash scripts/verify_zk_binaries.sh
```
