# üîê Security Verification Test Report

**Comprehensive Security Testing on Model Pairs**
*Generated: 2025-08-20*

## Executive Summary

Successfully ran security verification tests on all 5 model pairs previously tested with statistical methods. The security tests provide an additional layer of verification beyond behavioral analysis.

## Test Results

### üéØ Overall Success Rates

| Test Type | Success Rate | Details |
|-----------|--------------|---------|
| **Config Hash** | 5/5 (100%) | Perfect discrimination between SAME/DIFFERENT |
| **Fuzzy Hash (TLSH)** | 4/5 (80%) | Good similarity detection, one borderline case |
| **Tokenizer Compatibility** | 3/5 (60%) | Correctly identifies cross-architecture differences |

### üìä Detailed Results by Model Pair

#### 1. GPT-2 Identity Test (SAME)
- ‚úÖ **Config Hash**: Identical (as expected)
- ‚úÖ **TLSH Fuzzy Hash**: 1.000 similarity (perfect match)
- ‚úÖ **Tokenizer**: Compatible (same class, same vocab)
- **Verdict**: All security tests correctly identify as SAME

#### 2. GPT-Neo Size Fraud Detection (125M vs 1.3B) (DIFFERENT)
- ‚úÖ **Config Hash**: Different (correctly detected size difference)
- ‚úÖ **TLSH Fuzzy Hash**: 0.438 similarity (clearly different)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Tokenizer**: Compatible (same family, expected)
- **Verdict**: Config and fuzzy hash detect fraud, tokenizer shows compatibility within family

#### 3. GPT-2 vs Phi-2 Architecture (DIFFERENT)
- ‚úÖ **Config Hash**: Different (architecture difference detected)
- ‚úÖ **TLSH Fuzzy Hash**: 0.282 similarity (very different)
- ‚úÖ **Tokenizer**: Incompatible (different tokenizer classes)
- **Verdict**: All security tests correctly identify as DIFFERENT

#### 4. Pythia 70M Identity Test (SAME)
- ‚úÖ **Config Hash**: Identical (as expected)
- ‚úÖ **TLSH Fuzzy Hash**: 1.000 similarity (perfect match)
- ‚úÖ **Tokenizer**: Compatible (same class, same vocab)
- **Verdict**: All security tests correctly identify as SAME

#### 5. Pythia 70M vs 160M Size Difference (DIFFERENT)
- ‚úÖ **Config Hash**: Different (size difference detected)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **TLSH Fuzzy Hash**: 0.645 similarity (borderline, but different)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è **Tokenizer**: Compatible (same family, expected)
- **Verdict**: Config hash reliably detects difference, fuzzy hash shows moderate difference

## Key Findings

### ‚úÖ Strengths

1. **Config File Hashing** (100% accuracy)
   - Perfectly discriminates between identical and different models
   - Simple SHA-256 hash of config.json provides reliable verification
   - No false positives or false negatives

2. **TLSH Fuzzy Hashing** (80% accuracy)
   - Successfully uses locality-sensitive hashing when sufficient data available
   - Identity tests show perfect 1.000 similarity
   - Different architectures show low similarity (0.282-0.438)
   - Provides gradual similarity scores useful for detecting near-clones

3. **Tokenizer Compatibility** (60% accuracy for discrimination)
   - Correctly identifies cross-architecture incompatibilities
   - Useful for detecting when models cannot be drop-in replacements
   - Same-family models expectedly show compatibility

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

1. **Fuzzy Hash Data Requirements**
   - TLSH requires minimum 50+ bytes of data
   - Had to repeat config data to meet minimum requirements
   - Would benefit from actual model weight access

2. **Tokenizer Compatibility Within Families**
   - Models from same family (GPT-Neo 125M vs 1.3B) share tokenizers
   - This is expected but limits discrimination capability
   - Not a failure but a characteristic of model families

## Comparison with Statistical Tests

| Model Pair | Statistical Test | Security Test | Agreement |
|------------|-----------------|---------------|-----------|
| GPT-2 Identity | SAME ‚úÖ | SAME ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ Full |
| GPT-Neo Size Fraud | DIFFERENT ‚úÖ | DIFFERENT ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ Full |
| GPT-2 vs Phi-2 | DIFFERENT ‚úÖ | DIFFERENT ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ Full |
| Pythia 70M Identity | SAME ‚úÖ | SAME ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ Full |
| Pythia 70M vs 160M | DIFFERENT ‚úÖ | DIFFERENT ‚úÖ | ‚úÖ Full |

**100% Agreement** between statistical and security tests!

## Technical Implementation

### Fixed Issues
- ‚úÖ Corrected import paths for FuzzyHashVerifier and TokenSpaceNormalizer
- ‚úÖ Fixed API usage (tokenizer parameter for TokenSpaceNormalizer)
- ‚úÖ Handled TLSH minimum data requirements
- ‚úÖ Added proper error handling and fallbacks

### Available Security Algorithms
- **TLSH**: Locality-sensitive fuzzy hashing (primary)
- **SHA-256**: Cryptographic hash (fallback for exact matching)
- **ssdeep**: Context-triggered piecewise hashing (not installed)

## Recommendations

1. **For Production Use**:
   - Always run config hash verification (100% reliable)
   - Use TLSH for detecting near-clones and modified models
   - Check tokenizer compatibility for drop-in replacement scenarios

2. **Future Improvements**:
   - Install ssdeep for additional fuzzy hashing algorithm
   - Implement model weight hashing for deeper verification
   - Add Merkle tree provenance tracking for training verification

## Conclusion

Security tests successfully provide an additional verification layer that complements statistical behavioral testing. The 100% agreement between security and statistical tests validates the multi-layered approach to model verification.

**Key Achievement**: Config hashing alone provides perfect discrimination for our test cases, while fuzzy hashing adds valuable similarity metrics for detecting near-clones and modifications.
