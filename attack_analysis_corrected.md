# Attack Resistance Results - Corrected Analysis

## Actual Test Results (50 rounds per attack)

### Detection Performance by Attack Type:

| Attack Type | Detection Rate | Success Rate | Notes |
|------------|---------------|--------------|-------|
| **Wrapper Attacks** | 100% | 0% | ✅ Excellent - All wrapper variants detected |
| **Fine-tuning Attacks** | 0% | 100% | ❌ Critical - Not detecting fine-tuned models |
| **Compression Attacks** | 56% | 44% | ⚠️ Variable - Depends on compression level |
| **Combined Attacks** | 100% | 0% | ✅ Excellent - Multi-technique attacks detected |
| **Overall Average** | 56.8% | 43.2% | ⚠️ Needs improvement |

### Detailed Breakdown:

#### ✅ Strong Defense (100% Detection):
- Simple Wrapper Attack
- Adaptive Wrapper Attack  
- Sophisticated Wrapper Attack
- Heavy Compression (>90% model compression)
- Multi-technique Combined Attack

#### ❌ Critical Vulnerabilities (0% Detection):
- Minimal Fine-tuning (1 epoch, low LR)
- Moderate Fine-tuning (5 epochs)
- Aggressive Fine-tuning (20 epochs)
- Light Compression (<10% compression)

#### ⚠️ Partial Defense:
- Medium Compression: 68% detection (32% evasion)

### Key Findings:

1. **Fine-tuning is the biggest vulnerability**: The system cannot distinguish between the original model and fine-tuned versions when they maintain similar weights. This is because fine-tuning with the same architecture preserves most of the model's behavior.

2. **Wrapper attacks are effectively blocked**: Any attempt to wrap the model with input/output transformations is immediately detected due to behavioral differences.

3. **Compression detection correlates with compression amount**: 
   - Light compression (90% of original): Not detected
   - Medium compression (50% of original): 68% detection
   - Heavy compression (10% of original): 100% detection

4. **False Positive Rate: 0%**: The system doesn't incorrectly reject legitimate models, which is good for avoiding disruption.

### Interpretation:

The "overall 56.8% detection" is the average across ALL attack types, but this is misleading because:
- Some attacks (wrappers) are perfectly defended against
- Others (fine-tuning) are not defended at all
- The defense quality is attack-specific, not uniform

### Recommendations:

1. **For Fine-tuning Detection**: Need to implement weight distribution analysis and gradient-based verification
2. **For Light Compression**: Lower the similarity threshold or add compression-specific detection
3. **Current System is Good For**: Detecting wrapper attacks and major model modifications
4. **Current System is Vulnerable To**: Fine-tuning attacks and minor modifications
