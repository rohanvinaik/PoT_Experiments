Enhanced Difference Verification Summary
========================================
Mode: audit_grade
Decision: DIFFERENT
Reason: Effect size 0.886419 ≥ δ* 0.1 and RME 0.003 ≤ 0.1

Configuration:
--------------
Confidence: 99%
γ (SAME band): 0.010000
δ* (DIFFERENT threshold): 0.100000
ε_diff (RME target): 0.100

Results:
--------
Samples used: 32 (effective: 2048)
Mean difference: 0.883911
Standard deviation: 0.202142
CI: [0.881403, 0.886419]
Half-width: 0.002508
RME: 0.003

Performance:
------------
Total time: 55.63s
Scores per second: 0.6

Interpretation:
---------------
Models are statistically different (higher). The mean difference 0.883911 has effect size exceeding the threshold 0.100000 with sufficient precision (RME=0.003 ≤ 0.100). This indicates a material behavioral difference.

Next Steps:
-----------
• Investigate source of behavioral difference
• Run secondary verification methods (fuzzy hash, provenance)
• Check for unauthorized modifications or attacks
