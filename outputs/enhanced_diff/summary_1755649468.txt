ε_diff (RME target): 0.100

Results:
--------
Samples used: 32 (effective: 2048)
Mean difference: 0.124667
Standard deviation: 0.017554
CI: [0.121766, 0.127567]
Half-width: 0.002901
RME: 0.023

Performance:
------------
Total time: 0.01s
Scores per second: 2162.7

Interpretation:
---------------
Models are statistically different (higher). The mean difference 0.124667 has effect size exceeding the threshold 0.038446 with sufficient precision (RME=0.023 ≤ 0.100). This indicates a material behavioral difference.

Next Steps:
-----------
• Investigate source of behavioral difference
• Run secondary verification methods (fuzzy hash, provenance)
• Check for unauthorized modifications or attacks
