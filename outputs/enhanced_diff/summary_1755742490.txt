Enhanced Difference Verification Summary
========================================
Mode: audit_grade
Decision: DIFFERENT
Reason: Effect size 0.438267 ≥ δ* 0.1 and RME 0.011 ≤ 0.1

Configuration:
--------------
Confidence: 99%
γ (SAME band): 0.010000
δ* (DIFFERENT threshold): 0.100000
ε_diff (RME target): 0.100

Results:
--------
Samples used: 32 (effective: 2048)
Mean difference: 0.433594
Standard deviation: 0.292095
CI: [0.428921, 0.438267]
Half-width: 0.004673
RME: 0.011

Performance:
------------
Total time: 54.95s
Scores per second: 0.6

Interpretation:
---------------
Models are statistically different (higher). The mean difference 0.433594 has effect size exceeding the threshold 0.100000 with sufficient precision (RME=0.011 ≤ 0.100). This indicates a material behavioral difference.

Next Steps:
-----------
• Investigate source of behavioral difference
• Run secondary verification methods (fuzzy hash, provenance)
• Check for unauthorized modifications or attacks
