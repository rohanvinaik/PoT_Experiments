========================================
Mode: quick_gate
Decision: SAME
Reason: CI [-0.003705, 0.009851] within ±0.015 and half_width 0.006778 ≤ 0.007500

Configuration:
--------------
Confidence: 98%
γ (SAME band): 0.015000
δ* (DIFFERENT threshold): 0.100000
ε_diff (RME target): 0.200

Results:
--------
Samples used: 20 (effective: 640)
Mean difference: 0.003073
Standard deviation: 0.000949
CI: [-0.003705, 0.009851]
Half-width: 0.006778

Performance:
------------
Total time: 0.01s
Scores per second: 1528.9

Interpretation:
---------------
Models are statistically equivalent. The mean difference 0.003073 with 98% CI [-0.003705, 0.009851] is entirely within the equivalence band ±0.015000, and precision requirement (half_width ≤ 0.007500) is met. This indicates no material difference in behavior.

Next Steps:
-----------
• Models verified as equivalent within tolerance
• Consider tightening γ if stricter equivalence needed
• May proceed with model deployment/replacement
