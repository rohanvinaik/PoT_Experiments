Mode: quick_gate
Decision: UNDECIDED
Reason: Reached n_max without meeting decision criteria

Configuration:
--------------
Confidence: 98%
γ (SAME band): 0.015000
δ* (DIFFERENT threshold): 0.100000
ε_diff (RME target): 0.200

Results:
--------
Samples used: 120 (effective: 3840)
Mean difference: nan
Standard deviation: nan
CI: [nan, nan]
Half-width: nan

Performance:
------------
Total time: 9.65s
Scores per second: 12.4

Interpretation:
---------------
Unable to make a definitive decision with current data after 120 samples. CI extends outside equivalence band ±0.015000. Effect size nan below threshold 0.100000. Consider: (1) increasing samples to ~120, (2) using K=64 positions, (3) checking model loading, or (4) trying a different scoring metric.

Next Steps:
-----------
• Increase K to 64 positions per prompt
• Ensure score clipping range is appropriate
• Effect size too small - may be near-clones or need different score metric
