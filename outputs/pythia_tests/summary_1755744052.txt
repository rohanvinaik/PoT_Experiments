Enhanced Difference Verification Summary
========================================
Mode: quick_gate
Decision: DIFFERENT
Reason: Effect size 0.386026 ≥ δ* 0.1 and RME 0.041 ≤ 0.2

Configuration:
--------------
Confidence: 98%
γ (SAME band): 0.015000
δ* (DIFFERENT threshold): 0.100000
ε_diff (RME target): 0.200

Results:
--------
Samples used: 12 (effective: 384)
Mean difference: 0.370966
Standard deviation: 0.235750
CI: [0.355905, 0.386026]
Half-width: 0.015060
RME: 0.041

Performance:
------------
Total time: 10.03s
Scores per second: 1.2

Interpretation:
---------------
Models are statistically different (higher). The mean difference 0.370966 has effect size exceeding the threshold 0.100000 with sufficient precision (RME=0.041 ≤ 0.200). This indicates a material behavioral difference.

Next Steps:
-----------
• Investigate source of behavioral difference
• Run secondary verification methods (fuzzy hash, provenance)
• Check for unauthorized modifications or attacks
