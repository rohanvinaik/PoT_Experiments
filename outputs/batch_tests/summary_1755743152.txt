Confidence: 98%
γ (SAME band): 0.015000
δ* (DIFFERENT threshold): 0.100000
ε_diff (RME target): 0.200

Results:
--------
Samples used: 12 (effective: 384)
Mean difference: 0.758464
Standard deviation: 0.433825
CI: [0.741623, 0.775304]
Half-width: 0.016841
RME: 0.022

Performance:
------------
Total time: 26.10s
Scores per second: 0.5

Interpretation:
---------------
Models are statistically different (higher). The mean difference 0.758464 has effect size exceeding the threshold 0.100000 with sufficient precision (RME=0.022 ≤ 0.200). This indicates a material behavioral difference.

Next Steps:
-----------
• Investigate source of behavioral difference
• Run secondary verification methods (fuzzy hash, provenance)
• Check for unauthorized modifications or attacks
