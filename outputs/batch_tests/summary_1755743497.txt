Enhanced Difference Verification Summary
========================================
Mode: quick_gate
Decision: DIFFERENT
Reason: Effect size 1.011250 ≥ δ* 0.1 and RME 0.011 ≤ 0.2

Configuration:
--------------
Confidence: 98%
γ (SAME band): 0.015000
δ* (DIFFERENT threshold): 0.100000
ε_diff (RME target): 0.200

Results:
--------
Samples used: 12 (effective: 384)
Mean difference: 1.000000
Standard deviation: 0.000001
CI: [0.988750, 1.011250]
Half-width: 0.011250
RME: 0.011

Performance:
------------
Total time: 15.61s
Scores per second: 0.8

Interpretation:
---------------
Models are statistically different (higher). The mean difference 1.000000 has effect size exceeding the threshold 0.100000 with sufficient precision (RME=0.011 ≤ 0.200). This indicates a material behavioral difference.

Next Steps:
-----------
• Investigate source of behavioral difference
• Run secondary verification methods (fuzzy hash, provenance)
• Check for unauthorized modifications or attacks
