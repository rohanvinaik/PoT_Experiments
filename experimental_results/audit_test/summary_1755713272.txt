Interpretation:
---------------
Unable to make a definitive decision with current data after 400 samples. CI extends outside equivalence band ±0.000339. Effect size 0.003117 below threshold 0.038288. Consider: (1) increasing samples to ~400, (2) using K=128 positions, (3) checking model loading, or (4) trying a different scoring metric.

Next Steps:
-----------
• Increase K to 128 positions per prompt
• Ensure score clipping range is appropriate
• Effect size too small - may be near-clones or need different score metric
