Interpretation:
---------------
Unable to make a definitive decision with current data after 16 samples. CI extends outside equivalence band ±0.002000. Effect size 0.050672 below threshold 0.150000. Consider: (1) increasing samples to ~14, (2) using K=64 positions, (3) checking model loading, or (4) trying a different scoring metric.

Next Steps:
-----------
• Increase K to 64 positions per prompt
• Ensure score clipping range is appropriate
• Effect size too small - may be near-clones or need different score metric
