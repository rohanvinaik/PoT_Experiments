📊 VALIDATION STATUS SUMMARY
============================
✅ Build Integrity Claims: All deterministic plumbing and audit claims verified
✅ Statistical Framework: Runtime black-box identity claims validated on open model pairs
✅ Error Control: Proper (α,β) with anytime CIs and auditable logs
✅ Academic Rigor: Complete separation of build integrity vs runtime performance

⚠️ LIMITATIONS AND SCOPE
========================
• Near-clone cases may require more queries than n_max for decisive outcomes
• Decisions depend on (K, challenge mix, thresholds) - configuration affects sensitivity  
• Watermark-based systems are not comparable - this framework uses behavioral fingerprinting
• UNDECIDED outcomes indicate need for more samples or threshold tuning
• Apple Silicon MPS timing may not reflect production CPU/GPU performance
