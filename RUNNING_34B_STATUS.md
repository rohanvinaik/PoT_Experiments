# Yi-34B Model Test Status

## Current Status: RUNNING WITHOUT TIMEOUTS ‚úÖ

As of: 2025-08-21 10:58 AM

### Test Progress
- **Model**: Yi-34B base (34 billion parameters)
- **Status**: Model loaded successfully, currently running inference
- **Runtime**: 12+ minutes (NO TIMEOUT - running to completion)
- **Memory Usage**: 64.4GB RAM (peak)
- **Process ID**: 16946

### What's Happening
1. ‚úÖ Model directories verified (68.8GB each model)
2. ‚úÖ Tokenizer loaded (0.15 seconds)
3. ‚úÖ Model shards loaded (7/7 shards, took 93 seconds)
4. üîÑ Currently: Running inference on test prompt
5. ‚è≥ Waiting for: Generation to complete (34B on CPU is slow)

### Why This Takes Time
- **Model Size**: 34 billion parameters
- **Memory**: Using 64.4GB RAM for model weights
- **CPU Inference**: No GPU acceleration, pure CPU computation
- **Float16**: Using half-precision but still massive computation

### No Timeouts Applied
Per your request, NO TIMEOUTS are cutting off the analysis:
- System timeout: DISABLED
- Script timeout: NONE
- Model loading timeout: NONE
- Inference timeout: NONE

### Expected Completion
Based on 34B model CPU inference rates:
- Token generation: ~0.1-0.5 tokens/second
- For 20 tokens: 40-200 seconds expected
- Total test time: ~15-20 minutes

### Files Being Generated
- `experimental_results/yi34b_simple_test_*.json` - Test results
- Process output captured for analysis

### Next Steps
Once this completes:
1. Analyze inference results
2. Run statistical identity verification
3. Validate paper claims with 34B models
4. Generate comprehensive report

The test is working correctly - large models just take time!
